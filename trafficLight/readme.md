# Traffic Light Simulation with Arduino

This project simulates a traffic light system using an Arduino board.

## Features
- Simulates a real-world traffic light sequence
- Utilizes LEDs to represent the red, yellow, and green lights

## Technologies Used
- Arduino
- C/C++

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/sadegh15khedry/ArduinoProjects.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the `trafficLight` directory:
    ```sh
    cd ArduinoProjects/trafficLight
    ```
3. Upload the `trafficLight.ino` file to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.

## Usage
- Connect the LEDs to the appropriate pins as defined in the `trafficLight.ino` file.
- Power on the Arduino to start the simulation.
