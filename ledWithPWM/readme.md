# LED with PWM Control

This project demonstrates how to control the brightness of an LED using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) with an Arduino.

## Features
- Controls LED brightness using PWM
- Adjustable brightness through code

## Technologies Used
- Arduino
- C/C++

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/sadegh15khedry/ArduinoProjects.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the `ledWithPWM` directory:
    ```sh
    cd ArduinoProjects/ledWithPWM
    ```
3. Upload the `ledWithPWM.ino` file to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.

## Usage
- Connect the LED to the appropriate PWM pin as defined in the `ledWithPWM.ino` file.
- Power on the Arduino to see the LED brightness controlled by PWM.
